<h1 align = 'center'>✨ OPERATING SYSTEMS IN C ✨</h1>

A comprehensive collection of *Operating System concepts* implemented using *C programming*.  
This repository serves as a personal learning archive and practical reference for understanding how core OS mechanisms work at a low level through hands-on implementation.

<pre>
Operating-Systems-in-C/
  ├── process/

Each folder contains C programs related to specific Operating System concepts and algorithms.



## 🧩 Topics Covered

- Process creation and termination
- Parent–child processes (fork, exec, wait)
- CPU Scheduling Algorithms:
  - FCFS
  - SJF (Preemptive & Non-preemptive)
  - Priority Scheduling
  - Round Robin
- Process synchronization
- Critical section problem
- Semaphores and mutexes
- Deadlock concepts and simulations
- Basic system-level programming concepts



## ⚙️ How to Compile and Run

Use any standard C compiler such as GCC.

```bash
# To compile
gcc filename.c -o output

# To run
./output
```
Programs are best tested on Linux / Unix-based systems, but they can also be compiled using online IDEs like *OnlineGDB* or *Programiz*.



## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand internal working of Operating System concepts  
- Learn how processes are created, scheduled, and synchronized  
- Analyze scheduling algorithms and their performance  
- Strengthen low-level programming skills in C  
- Prepare for OS labs, exams, and vivas  



## 📚 Tools & Language

- *Language:* C  
- *Compiler:* GCC  
- *Editor:* VS Code  
- *Platform:* Linux / Unix-based systems
